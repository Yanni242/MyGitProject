Added python quiz to repository 

This quiz asks the user to input a number.
It then takes the sum of the factors from the number inputted and outputs a new number.
The options are given to the user a, b, c, or d.
The user must select one of the options of which they think the was done to their number.
The options are: Factorial, Number * 2, sum of the factors, or, just some magic.
The program will continue to run until they have selected the correct option.
When the correct answer is inputted "Correct!" will appear and the program will end.
